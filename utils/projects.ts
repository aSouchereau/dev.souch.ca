        description: "City Cyclery is a local bike shop in Windsor, ON. The project involved a small rebrand, and a new website. I was a part of a 4 person team for this project, and took on a project management role. We used Microsoft Project to create an overall timeline for the project, and a Github Project for development tasks. We built the site in NextJs with Typescript and used TailwindCSS for styles. The tasks were split mostly evenly, so we all got to solve a diverse set of problems. My main focus was on the events api and page.",

I had used it for a few weeks and was happy with it. However, I felt like it lacked some features that could be solved by creating a management system on top of it.The system is built in Laravel and uses some bootstrap, but is otherwise entirely custom. It is currently available only as a docker image, but I plan on adding Kubernetes support.",
