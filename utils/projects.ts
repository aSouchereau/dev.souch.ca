            "The goal of this project was to provide a new marketing site for the client City Cyclery to replace their aging and insecure wordpress site.",
            "This work was produced in a collaborative effort by a small team of St. Clair College students, including myself. In four months we coordinated with the client to gather requirements, draft a design, develop prototypes, write code, test, and deliver the final site. Despite the tight deadlines between phases and being preoccupied with other school work, we managed to execute our plans as best as we could, and deliver on-time with no issues (helps that the scope was relatively small).",
            "We primarily focused on content and SEO, and made huge improvements in accessibility, responsiveness, and performance over the old site. This was helped by our decision to use NextJs, which comes with SSG and plenty of other optimization tools out of the box. Using these, we were achieved Google Lighthouse scores in the high 90s across the board."
